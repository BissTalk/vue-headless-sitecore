# Headless Sitecore for Vue.js

I am eagerly waiting for the release of **JavaScript Services For Sitecore** (or JSS) scheduled to be released with Sitecore 9.1. 
You can read more about JSS [here](https://jss.sitecore.net/) and there are some great examples [here](https://github.com/Sitecore/jss) as well.
JSS and the new [SXA Layout Service](https://doc.sitecore.net/sitecore_experience_accelerator/data_modeling/json/use_sxa_layout_service_to_model_your_pages_in_json) that it was built on solves an iteresting problem that has kept comming us for me resently. 
How can I build a content service that has all the bells and wistles of Sitcore (personalization, tracking, etc.) without sitecore rendering HTML?

This project is a test project (not meant for production) were I am experimenting with some of the ideas in the SXA Layout Service and JSS and applying them to Sitecore 8.1.
